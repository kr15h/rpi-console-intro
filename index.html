		<h1>RPi Console Intro</h1>
		<p>Most used Linux console commands for operating on the Raspperry Pi.</p>

		<p>This is a list of frequently used console commands while using Raspberry Pi with Raspbian. This document is a combination of knowledge gathered from online materials and experience. Feel free to contribute via <a href="https://github.com/kr15h/rpi-console-intro">GitHub</a>.</p>

		<p>This is important once you start to dig deeper in programming. It does not matter what kind of programming as the console is used a lot as in web, app and other kind of development today. This was made to support a couple of Raspberry Pi workshops.</p>

		<h2>The commands</h2>
		<div class="list-group">
            <a href="#" class="list-group-item">
              <h4>ls</h4>
              <p>Lists curent directory contents. By issuing this command you can see what files and folders there are in the current directory you are.</p>
            </a>
            <a href="#" class="list-group-item">
              <h4>pwd</h4>
              <p>Tells the current directory you are in starting from the root level. For example:</p>
              <pre>/home/pi/user</pre>
            </a>
            <a href="#" class="list-group-item">
              <h4>cd</h4>
              <p>Change directory. This is the main navigation command</p>
            </a>
          </div>
